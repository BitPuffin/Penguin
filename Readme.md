Penguin
=======

This is the *source code* for my website.

The purpose of my site is mainly to host a blog, showcase projects I've done
and host things like portfolio + resum√©.

It should be fairly easy to extend and add more functionality if I, or anyone
else need it. Every part of the site is actually it's own little website.
However they all share the public/ directory and also inherit some of the things
from the base module (Penguin), like csrf protection and helpers.
