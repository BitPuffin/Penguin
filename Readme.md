Penguin
=======

This is the *source code* for my website.

The purpose of my site is mainly to host a blog, showcase projects I've done
and host things like portfolio + resum√©.

It should be fairly easy to extend and add more functionality if I, or anyone
else need it. Every part of the site is actually it's own little website.
However they all share the public/ directory and also inherit some of the things
from the base module (Penguin), like csrf protection and helpers.

Seriously *go read the license* it is short and I love it. If there isn't
a file called License in the distribution, someone should go to JAIL!
But come on, if you are gonna use this software, read the license. It is like
10 lines of text, and reading it is for the better if you aren't familiar with
the license.
